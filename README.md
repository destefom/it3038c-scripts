To use:
type in the operator you wish to use for your problem (+, -, *, /)
afterwards, type in the first number and then the second number.

The output should repeat the problem that you inputed followed by the answer.
EX) you input '+' for addition followed by the two numbers you wish to add together (ex. 7 and 3)
the output should appear as:
7 + 3 =
10
*because the user must input the type of operation they want at the beginning, the actual code for the operations must be written within if/else statements. Otherwise all 4 operations will be performed even if that is not the desired outcome.
