it3038c Project 3: Plant Quiz

About:
It is quite common to see houseplants anywhere like restaurants, stores, schools, offices, or even... your house. 
Becuase they are so common and a lot of people are fond of them, I made a simple quiz about them.
Maybe you can learn something you didn't know before about common plants, or maybe you'll notice them more if you ever see any.

To run:
To take the quiz, download the plant_quiz.py file. 
Go to your command prompt and type plant_quiz.py from the location you have it downloaded to.
Or you can just open it directly from your files.

Explanation:
1) The questions were made into a dictionary with the answers given next to them as keys.
Next, the answers are written in lists since the questions are all multiple choice

2) Game is split into 4 different sections: 
- new_quiz: this is when the file is first opened. This is how the quiz is actually ran and organized.
- check_answer: this analyzes the answers given by the player and determines whether they are correct or not.
- show_score: takes the number of correct answers and calculates the score as a percentage.
- quiz_plus: asks the player if they want to play again after one round has been completed
